            Bio
        </h2>
        <p>
            I am a husband and father of 2. 
            I started learning about computers when I was 8 years old.
        </p>
        <p>
            My first computer experience was when my uncle brought home a commodore 64.
            This did include the tape deck.
        </p>
        <p>
            Since that day I was hooked. Every class I could take in school or something I could learn from a friend was all I focused on.
        </p>
